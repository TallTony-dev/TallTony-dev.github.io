# Personal Website

I am by no means a web developer, but I'm pretty happy with this simple little design, mainly because I challenged myself to not use any Javascript, and to solely rely on CSS and HTML in order to make an interesting and interactive design with high performance and small size. Thank you to [Christian Schaefer](https://codepen.io/Schepp) for the original idea of using anchors and a hidden scrollable flexbox container in order to create the carousel effect that can be seen on the website, as I would be completely stumped by my lack of knowledge otherwise.

The website is far better viewed on desktop currently.
