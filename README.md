# Personal Website

I am by no means a web developer, but I'm pretty happy with this simple little design, mainly because I challenged myself to not use any Javascript, and to only rely on css and html in order to make an interesting design. Thank you to [Christian Schaefer](https://codepen.io/Schepp) for the original idea of using anchors and a hidden scrollable flexbox container in order to create the carousel effect that can be seen on the website, as I would be completely stumped by my lack of knowledge otherwise.
