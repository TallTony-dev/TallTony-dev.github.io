                Music is generally pretty nice, I like a wide variety, but I tend towards some punk, a bunch of types of jazz, more inspired/musical rap,
                yacht rock, breakbeat, speedcore, grungier bedroom pop, a bit of R&B/Soul, a bunch of indie stuff, and a good chunk of more experimental stuff (some hip hop, some idk what genre lol)

                I LOVE little computer chips and programming as a hobby uninfluenced by a desire for capital or any other significant personal material gain

                Guestbooks and comment sections that you don't need to log in to use are a lot of fun
            </p>

                Recreational sports are among the last good social platforms that don't cost much, and its a shame that the people who play sports are generally mediocre to be around in my experience
                unless casual, in which case theres a good chunk of nice people

                Education is enjoyable and having more knowledge makes people nicer generally

                Sitting on a bench and just looking at something is really fun

                Capitalism isn't really all that bad when proper regulations and antitrust policies are in place
            </p>

                Always going to extremes and avoiding mediocrity in most cases where your life is not on the line is fun to do
                and lets you experience a wider range of emotion

                I love being happy and I love being sad, I love being frustrated and stumped, I don't like being angry at others much but thats just a personal preference
