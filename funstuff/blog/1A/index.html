                I'm so happy to be in university and studying something I'm passionate about, it feels very freeing.
                At the same time it's been a little difficult adjusting routines but we ball.
                I'm still looking for 'my people' but I've found good enough people for the time being.
                I have a feeling each 4 month term will bring something new and a new set of people, though I hope to find a couple people that I stick with through the years.
                Idk if that means a partner or not because long distance sounds like a horrendus thing to put yourself through, so probably just friends for now unless I find 'the one'.
                I will be ashamedly subscribing to short term relationships for the time being :P.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love education so much and I hope that the other people here find that passion too, cause a
                lot of people just seem to be in it for the money, though I think they'll just find more misery.
                Doing what you hate for the rest of your life to make money is really not the move cause you spend most of your life working, might as well enjoy it.

                Its been like 3-4 weeks or something at this point and I got a co-op interview for Ford! :D
                I also met someone else who got an interview for the same position lol. I don't know if I'm gonna
                be able to land the job cause it has a couple required things I'm not perfectly familiar with, though
                they must be confident enough in me cause they gave me an interview atleast. I really wanna land it tho
                cause the pay is pretty goated for Canada and especially for first year, and the job uses C# and C++ both,
                which I enjoy a lot, (C is better tho).
            </p>
            <p>
                I interviewed for that position a couple days ago now, and I think that it went well and I have a decent
                chance of landing it, but for now I'm just going to move on as though I didn't get it cause I'd be stressing otherwise.
                I'll know in a few days (Oct 8) what I got 'ranked' or if I didn't get ranked at all for it, so no point thinking about
                it until then.
            </p>
            <p>
                I GOT THE JOB YAAAAYYYYY :D
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I don't have to worry about co-op until next study term which is really good, cause I can focus on midterms and just enjoy university :3.
                I feel like the summer projects I did really helped out, and being passionate was also probably a large part of it.
                They were looking mainly for someone who wanted to learn and I fit the bill with some previous knowledge too on the relevant things.
                Now I just need to start looking for housing and I'll be all good :)
            </p>
            <p>
                I kinda feel bad for posting on my story though because odds are that someone saw that and got more depressed and now feels more
                like a failure because "all my peers are getting coops" or similar untrue exxagerations. At the same time I don't think you should
                ever be humble just to make other people feel better though because thats kinda meh, though don't rub things in or anything obviously.
                I really hope I don't get a big ego because of this, and I feel bad for getting the job in a way too. Other people are struggling more and
                it feels wrong to be doing good when others nearby aren't. I think that its kinda dumb to feel like that though, as anyone is doing 
                better than someone, and unless you're pitying every other person on the planet every moment of the day you're a hypocrite in a way. 
                Having a blog feels really egotistical too though and is almost as bad as linkedin, but this is kinda obfuscated so I don't think its that 
                much of a thing as really only close friends or stalkers would see this. Anyways I'm still very joyous about this so we ball :3
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that the excitement for the coop position has mostly worn off, I'm studying for midterms (2 days in advance). I think its ok
                though because I've been learning everything along the way and making sure I know things as we go, though I'll find out if that works
                soon enough :P. I find it hard to sit down and just study often, and I enjoy learning along the way instead of just studying for an exam.
                I think that exams should just be there to make sure you've been learning, and not to be some big challenge to overcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ok I'm just over halfway through midterms now and got cracked by ECE150 this afternoon. Its kind of wild that even though I've
                done enough programming to get a coop at ford, I still didn't do so great on an introductory programming course midterm but we ball.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's the week after midterms and overall I think I did ok enough but theres definitly spots to improve. 
                I haven't gotten most marks back yet, but calculus was a 46, and my eng profession course was a 79ish so calc is obviously needing some work.
                'Halloweekend' is coming up and I feel pretty miserable, I made a CN tower costume but it doesn't really look too much like the cn tower lol.
                I have nowhere to wear it to though cause I don't really have anything planned for friday.
                I feel like I'm probably missing out on some fun but I don't really identify with people who party a ton so
                it'd be tough to get invited to anything :P. Currently I'm planning on going around and throwing candy at people who are studying or just alone on friday.
                If I was there I'd appreciate someone else atleast acknowledging my existence, so I'm gonna do that and call it reverse trick or treating.
                Man its pretty rough right now and I haven't found many people that I truly identify with and could call close friends.
                I don't think you really need close friends as long as you care about yourself as I've thought before but it still hurts.
                Man damn I hope I find someone else to fawn over cause I'm tired of typing 'I' in these paragraphs lol.
                I don't think anyone will actually ever read this lest my parents find it though they probably wouldn't say if they did.
                I really hope someone does at some point.
                Someone I was with for a little bit said a few times that he thinks I hate people and it stuck with me,
                I don't think I hate people but in my actions it must show in some way or another because I have a hard time ever truly integrating
                into a 'friend group' of sorts and I run away.
                This has happened a few times where I have a good thing going and then I just become dissonant of taking it any further.
                I want to change but I don't know how, and I think subconsciously something pushes me away from what I want.
                If my dad saw this he'd probably be saying how I'm hurting myself and asking me why lol.
                I don't know why though and it's caused me to still be stuck.
                Maybe I just enjoy being a loser and not being tightly connected to a friend group.
                I really just need one other person to be happy mostly. Anything more than 3-4 other people is just excessive and becomes hard to maintain :P.
