                I'm so happy to be in university and studying something I'm passionate about, it feels very freeing.
                At the same time it's been a little difficult adjusting routines but we ball.
                I'm still looking for 'my people' but I've found good enough people for the time being.
                I have a feeling each 4 month term will bring something new and a new set of people, though I hope to find a couple people that I stick with through the years.
                Idk if that means a partner or not because long distance sounds like a horrendus thing to put yourself through, so probably just friends for now unless I find 'the one'.
                I will be ashamedly subscribing to short term relationships for the time being :P.
