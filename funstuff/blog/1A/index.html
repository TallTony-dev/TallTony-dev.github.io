                I'm so happy to be in university and studying something I'm passionate about, it feels very freeing.
                At the same time it's been a little difficult adjusting routines but we ball.
                I'm still looking for 'my people' but I've found good enough people for the time being.
                I have a feeling each 4 month term will bring something new and a new set of people, though I hope to find a couple people that I stick with through the years.
                Idk if that means a partner or not because long distance sounds like a horrendus thing to put yourself through, so probably just friends for now unless I find 'the one'.
                I will be ashamedly subscribing to short term relationships for the time being :P.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love education so much and I hope that the other people here find that passion too, cause a
                lot of people just seem to be in it for the money, though I think they'll just find more misery.
                Doing what you hate for the rest of your life to make money is really not the move cause you spend most of your life working, might as well enjoy it.

                Its been like 3-4 weeks or something at this point and I got a co-op interview for Ford! :D
                I also met someone else who got an interview for the same position lol. I don't know if I'm gonna
                be able to land the job cause it has a couple required things I'm not perfectly familiar with, though
                they must be confident enough in me cause they gave me an interview atleast. I really wanna land it tho
                cause the pay is pretty goated for Canada and especially for first year, and the job uses C# and C++ both,
                which I enjoy a lot, (C is better tho).
            </p>
            <p>
                I interviewed for that position a couple days ago now, and I think that it went well and I have a decent
                chance of landing it, but for now I'm just going to move on as though I didn't get it cause I'd be stressing otherwise.
                I'll know in a few days (Oct 8) what I got 'ranked' or if I didn't get ranked at all for it, so no point thinking about
                it until then.
