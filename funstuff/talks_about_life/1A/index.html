            <p>Y'know sometimes its just nice to write about stuff
                and thats what this section is for.<br> I'm gonna be writing into this page
                every so often for the next while atleast I think, as long as I find the time to.<br>
                I don't know if anyone will ever see this because I think I'm gonna keep it pretty obfuscated<br>
                Drop me a message at 902-219-2434 if u do tho
            </p>
            <p>
                Ok now that you're here I'm gonna yap about things, and they might not make any sense at all, and might use wording that is inaccurate
                to potray whatever feeling I'm trying to potray.<br>
                Anyways I'm in university now and I find it so cool that I'm in whats pretty much the math and engineering capital of Canada.<br>
                Like those math contests come out of the buildings I walk through now.<br>
                It feels so cool to be amidst the top talents in Canada and I feel like theres a lot to learn here.<br>
                At the same time I find it interesting how very few people claim to be 'smart' here and how everyone really thinks they truly don't belong.<br>
                I find that the people that do think they're the best end up being pretty mediocre really in comparison.<br>
                I think that some people claim to be 'not smart' in order to not be shamed for not living up to expectations.<br>
                I think I do that myself a lot, but I don't think any harm comes of it.<br>
                Underpromising and overdelivering can be used well into your favour, as long as you promise enough to get a foot in the door.<br>
                Anyways gn, I gotta get my laundry now.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I've heard of a thing called 'I have no mouth and I must scream' and a lot of people relate it to ai.<br>
                I feel like for all of us, we have small enough mouths that our screams don't matter.<br>
                The world is an oven and we can either watch it slowly heat up or make it slightly cooler, but turning off the oven is out of the question.<br>
                We are tiny in comparison to modern society and by ourselves we can have little to no impact on it.<br>
                Working together we can accomplish much more, but you have to find like-minded people first.<br>
                I feel like I can only see 3 feet in front of me, and even if i look further there'd be nothing I could do to change much.<br>
                I think that happens because of how little time I have right now, and for a lot of people they've never had the time to look further.<br>
                I noticed this when I was working in traffic control, where being so busy, there's no time to do anything but sustain yourself :(

            </p>
            <p>
                I made a 67 joke in a group chat today and it wasn't whatsoever acknowledged, and I feel like that image of the cat with the propellor hat rn lol.
                I don't wanna be in that group chat anymore :((( but its ok it probably gets better. Also I'm gonna stop with the line breaks cause it messes up how the page looks a little :P.
            </p>

                Fml dawg seasonal depression is real and I'm feeling really down in the dumps and confused and lost. 
                Getting serious middle school flashbacks as I'm invited to come to one part of a hangout and then left out of another lol.
                I'd be a clown to actually go to do that cause joining to do a thing after the rest of a group has already gone to dinner together just singles you out.
                I really enjoy not being singled out for better or worse, and just being a part of things is the best feeling ever.
                A lot of the time there'll be something that makes me stick out whether it be height or any other thing and it makes me sad.
                I've already accepted in past that I'll probably never find a 'traditional' type of friend group because it sounds good, but in practice I find it tiring.
                Any group of people larger than 5 is a god awful thing to be in cause generally there'll just be two or three people running things and everyone else sits there talking.
                I don't even want to be one of the two or three though because I get nervous whenever I have a bunch of people just listening to what I say even tho its fine.
                Haven't yet found 'my people' but maybe soon I will. Fall makes me very melancholy but its ok i hope. glhf 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's the week after midterms and overall I think I did ok enough but theres definitly spots to improve. 
                I haven't gotten most marks back yet, but calculus was a 46, and my eng profession course was a 79ish so calc is obviously needing some work.
                'Halloweekend' is coming up and I feel pretty miserable, I made a CN tower costume but it doesn't really look too much like the cn tower lol.
                I have nowhere to wear it to though cause I don't really have anything planned for friday.
                I feel like I'm probably missing out on some fun but I don't really identify with people who party a ton so
                it'd be tough to get invited to anything :P. Currently I'm planning on going around and throwing candy at people who are studying or just alone on friday.
                If I was there I'd appreciate someone else atleast acknowledging my existence, so I'm gonna do that and call it reverse trick or treating.
                Man its pretty rough right now and I haven't found many people that I truly identify with and could call close friends.
                I don't think you really need close friends as long as you care about yourself as I've thought before but it still hurts.
                Man damn I hope I find someone else to fawn over cause I'm tired of typing 'I' in these paragraphs lol.
                I don't think anyone will actually ever read this lest my parents find it though they probably wouldn't say if they did.
                I really hope someone does at some point.
                Someone I was with for a little bit said a few times that he thinks I hate people and it stuck with me,
                I don't think I hate people but in my actions it must show in some way or another because I have a hard time ever truly integrating
                into a 'friend group' of sorts and I run away.
                This has happened a few times where I have a good thing going and then I just become dissonant of taking it any further.
                I want to change but I don't know how, and I think subconsciously something pushes me away from what I want.
                If my dad saw this he'd probably be saying how I'm hurting myself and asking me why lol.
                I don't know why though and it's caused me to still be stuck.
                Maybe I just enjoy being a loser and not being tightly connected to a friend group.
                I really just need one other person to be happy mostly. Anything more than 3-4 other people is just excessive and becomes hard to maintain :P.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel like I'm having my head bashed in with a frying pan at my own whim while noise blares in each ear deafening anything.
                I've been really angry without much reason and I don't really like it that much. I'm having a lot of heavy mood swings and I think it might just be the university experience.

                I'm now realizing that anyone who looks at the github repo can see this page lol I don't think anyone will though so we chillin\
                Either way I'm moving it into a subdirectory by terms in the same way the other blog is organized
