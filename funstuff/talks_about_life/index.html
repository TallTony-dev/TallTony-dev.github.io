            <p>Y'know sometimes its just nice to write about stuff
                and thats what this section is for.<br> I'm gonna be writing into this page
                every so often for the next while atleast I think, as long as I find the time to.<br>
                I don't know if anyone will ever see this because I think I'm gonna keep it pretty obfuscated<br>
                But thats ok I think<br><br>
                If you are reading this then PLEASE let me know you did<br>
                Maybe just dm me on some social media but its more fun to message me at 902-219-2434<br>
                Make sure u specify what ur talking about tho cause theres a lot of creative spam messages nowadays<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ok now that you're here I'm gonna yap about things, and they might not make any sense at all, and might use wording that is inaccurate
                to potray whatever feeling I'm trying to potray.<br>
                This was all written in times where I lack someone else to talk to about deep stuff so please don't hold any of this against me as I suck at saying what I feel lol.<br>
                Anyways I'm in university now and I find it so cool that I'm in whats pretty much the math and engineering capital of Canada.<br>
                Like those math contests come out of the buildings I walk through now.<br>
                It feels so cool to be amidst the top talents in Canada and I feel like theres a lot to learn here.<br>
                At the same time I find it interesting how very few people claim to be 'smart' here and how everyone really thinks they truly don't belong.<br>
                I find that the people that do think they're the best end up being pretty mediocre really in comparison.<br>
                I think that some people claim to be 'not smart' in order to not be shamed for not living up to expectations.<br>
                I think I do that myself a lot, but I don't think any harm comes of it.<br>
                Underpromising and overdelivering can be used well into your favour, as long as you promise enough to get a foot in the door.<br>
                Anyways gn, I gotta get my laundry now.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I've heard of a thing called 'I have no mouth and I must scream' and a lot of people relate it to ai.<br>
                I feel like for all of us, we have small enough mouths that our screams don't matter.<br>
                The world is an oven and we can either watch it slowly heat up or make it slightly cooler, but turning off the oven is out of the question.<br>
                We are tiny in comparison to modern society and by ourselves we can have little to no impact on it.<br>
                Working together we can accomplish much more, but you have to find like-minded people first.<br>
                I feel like I can only see 3 feet in front of me, and even if i look further there'd be nothing I could do to change much.<br>
                I think that happens because of how little time I have right now, and for a lot of people they've never had the time to look further.<br>
                I noticed this when I was working in traffic control, where being so busy, there's no time to do anything but sustain yourself.<br>
                I hope that one day everyone will have enough time to think.<br>

                I made a 67 joke in a group chat today and it wasn't whatsoever acknowledged, and I feel like that image of the cat with the propellor hat rn lol.
                I don't wanna be in that group chat anymore :((( but its ok it probably gets better. Also I'm gonna stop with the line breaks cause it messes up how the page looks a little :P.
